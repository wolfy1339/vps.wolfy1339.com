    <h4 id="uptime/support/sla">SLA, uptime, service info and support</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We run the systems based on a best-effort policy. We do not offer SLA or uptime guarante.</li>
      <li>Although we try our best, we can not guarantee that this service can be provided forever, so please expect that it can disappear at any time and make backups, backups and moar backups!</li>
      <li>Support (if any at all) is also based on a best-effort policy and mainly done in #fuslvz if it does not involve any personal information like real names, mail addresses, passwords, etc. Please talk to owners, staffers or supporters first in #fuslvz and ask them there if it's okay to be private messaged before doing so! None of us owners, staffers, supporters or users are under and obligation to reply to your support requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Permanently begging owners, staffers or supporters for help will result in suspension or even instant termination of your service without warning.</b>


    <h4 id="requesting">Requesting a FuslVZ container</h4>
    <p>To request a FuslVZ container, please tell us the following details into the channel #fuslvz (you can omit your mail address, an owner, staffer or supporter will ask you for your mail address by private message then).</p>
    <ul>   
      <li>Where do you come from? What channel? Did someone recommend us to you?</li>
      <li>What specifications do you need?
        <pre>How many CPU cores?<br/>How much MB/GB of RAM?<br/>How much GB of HDD space?</pre>
      </li>
      <li>What hostname do you wish for your new container?</li>
      <li>Please tell us your E-Mail address or we are not able to create you a SolusVM panel account. (Not needed when you want to be contacted and asked about your mail address by private message)</li>
      <li>All the above details have to be sent at once, otherwise we will silently ignore your request and you will never know if you get your FuslVZ container, or not.</li>
      <li>After requesting your FuslVZ container, please stay in the channel and don't change your nick!</li>
      <li>Permanently begging owners, staffers, supporters or users for your FuslVZ container will just unnecessary delay your request or it will be silently ignored. A request once every 6 hours is okay but not desirable if you already can see that our team is busy right now.</li>
      <li>You will get a response by private message, but please ask any further requests in the main channel!<br/>
      Once you get a response, it will look like: 
      <pre>freeXXXXXXXXXX<br/>ABCdef012xyz<br/>Main IP Address 1.2.3.4<br/>IPv6 Address 2000:123:45:67:89::abcd:ef12<br/>Root Password XYZ012DeFaBc<br/>where the first and the second lines are your login details for the SolusVM control panel (see below for the URL).<br/>
      The third and fourth line is the IP(v4) and the IPv6 address of your FuslVZ container and the last line is the<br/>SSH root password for your FuslVZ container.</pre></li>
      <li>It will take some seconds for the hostnode to create the image, fill the container with the default template and configure all the settings (usually ~10-20 seconds), so please be patient if your FuslVZ is not online directly after you got the login details!</li>
    </ul>
   
   <h4 id="other-faq">Other FAQ</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>The SolusVM panel for stopping, (re)starting, reinstalling, ... your FuslVZ container is reachable at <a href="https://v0b.hallowe.lt:5656/">https://v0b.hallowe.lt:5656/</a></li>
     <li>Servers are hosted at Fusl's private colo at Hetzner DC19 in Germany</li>
     <li>"Help, help, my application is not working"
     <pre>Please ask in the main channel if someone knows this application and got it already working. If the application is not working, we simply cannot change that.</pre></li>
     <li>"Can I change the reverse DNS of my IPv4 or IPv6 address?"
       <pre>It will be possible for you in the future to set the IPv4 or IPv6 reverse DNS for your IP address directly from the SolusVM panel. Please do not ask when this will happen, because we have no ETA for that yet.<br/>Until then, please beg an owner, staffer or supporter in the main channel for setting the reverse DNS. Don't forget to mention the IPv4/IPv6 address and also tell us if you want to have updated both, IPv4 and IPv6 address or not!</pre></li>
     <li>"Why are you doing this?"
       <pre>Well, I bought a server and put it into my colocation at Hetzner to make it part of the freenode IRC network. The server was up and running and no one <br/> used it because freenode didn't answer to sponsor request mails I've sent them. After a month of waiting for *ANY* response from freenode, I decided to <br/> put it into the private OpenVZ cluster I run for personal/private things. 3 months have passed and I still haven't got any answer from freenode and so I began to put free OpenVZ containers for good freenode friends I know on it (supermat, whiskers75, skasturi, nyuszika7h). And now there we are, <br/>project FuslVZ started and we already have a bunch of members and great staff!</pre></li>
